# Tactile Reading Software

In this project, the primary goal is to convert a standard image into a tactile image, which can be beneficial for various applications, particularly for individuals with visual impairments or for tactile-based object recognition systems. This conversion is achieved through a multi-stage process, with the saliency feature playing a crucial role.

### Saliency Feature in Image Processing

The **saliency feature** in image processing refers to a technique used to identify and highlight the most important or relevant areas within an image. It aims to capture regions that are likely to attract human attention or are of particular significance within the image. This feature is particularly useful for applications such as object detection and image segmentation.

### Saliency-Based Image Conversion

In the context of this project, the saliency feature is employed to transform standard images into tactile representations with an emphasis on the most significant elements. Here's how the process works:

1. **Image Loading:** The project starts by loading the input image using OpenCV.

2. **Saliency Computation:** The saliency feature is applied to the input image. This involves analyzing the image to identify areas that are salient or noteworthy. These areas are typically regions with distinct objects or features that draw human attention.

3. **Tactile Emphasis:** The identified salient areas are emphasized in the tactile image. This can be achieved through various techniques, such as adjusting contrast, brightness, or applying filters to enhance the tactile perception of these regions.

4. **Output Generation:** The final tactile image, with its salient features emphasized, is generated as the output. This image is optimized for tactile exploration, making it suitable for tactile-based object recognition or navigation.

### Applications of Tactile Images

The conversion of standard images into tactile representations has several practical applications:

- **Accessibility:** Tactile images are invaluable for individuals with visual impairments, providing a means for them to explore and understand visual content through touch.

- **Tactile Object Recognition:** Tactile images can be used in systems that recognize objects through touch, enabling robots or assistive devices to identify and interact with their surroundings.

- **Education:** Tactile images can be employed in educational materials to make visual content accessible to students with visual impairments.

- **Art and Design:** Tactile images can be utilized in art and design projects to create unique tactile artwork or design elements.

## Additional Information:

- **Smart India Hackathon 2022:** This project was presented at the Smart India Hackathon 2022.

- **MSME Grant:** The project received an MSME grant for Rs 3.90 lakhs in recognition of its value and innovation.

- **Project Version:** Note that the version presented here is the basic version of the project due to some internal reasons.

## Saliency Feature Explanation:

The saliency feature in image processing is a technique used to highlight and identify the most important or relevant areas of an image. This is particularly useful for applications like object detection, where you want to focus on the most significant parts of an image.

In the context of this project, the saliency feature may have been used to identify and prioritize key elements or regions in the images being processed during the conversion stages. For example, it could help emphasize critical details in medical images or distinguish essential components in other types of imagery.

Saliency maps generated by the feature can guide subsequent processing steps or assist in making decisions about which areas of an image to prioritize for further analysis or manipulation.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it as needed for your image conversion needs. For more details and code implementation, refer to the Python script files and modules in the project directory.

## Libraries Used:

- OpenCV: OpenCV is used for image processing tasks, including loading, processing, and saving images.
- NumPy: NumPy is used for performing numerical operations on image data.
- Tkinter: Tkinter is the GUI library used for creating the user interface.
- time module: The time module is used for timing and scheduling tasks.

## Running the Application:

1. **Open DeskGUI.py:** Start by opening the `DeskGUI.py` script.

2. **Load Images:** Click on the "Load" button in the GUI. Select the images you want to convert from your local file system.

3. **Conversion Process:** The selected images will go through a multi-stage conversion process.

4. **Output Images:** The final converted images will be saved in the "FOPImages" folder.

## Verification Images:

- The "OPV1Images" and "OPV2Images" folders contain images from stages 1 and 2 of the conversion process, which can be used for verification and comparison.

### Exception Cases:

1. **exception_case_1.jpg:** This image demonstrates an exception case where the image from stage 1 is sufficient, but passing it through stage 2 results in an undesired image.

2. **exception_case_2.jpg:** In this scenario, passing the image directly through stage 2 results in an unclear image that cannot be sensed properly.

## Program Structure:

The folder called "Program in modules" contains all the code organized into individual modules for better organization and maintainability.
