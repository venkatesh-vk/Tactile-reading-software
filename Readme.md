# Image Conversion System using OpenCV and Tkinter

This project is an image conversion system that uses OpenCV for image processing, NumPy for numerical operations, and Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). The system allows users to convert images through multiple stages, with the final output stored in the "FOPImages" folder.

## Libraries Used:

- OpenCV: OpenCV is used for image processing tasks, including loading, processing, and saving images.
- NumPy: NumPy is used for performing numerical operations on image data.
- Tkinter: Tkinter is the GUI library used for creating the user interface.
- time module: The time module is used for timing and scheduling tasks.

## Running the Application:

1. **Open DeskGUI.py:** Start by opening the `DeskGUI.py` script.

2. **Load Images:** Click on the "Load" button in the GUI. Select the images you want to convert from your local file system.

3. **Conversion Process:** The selected images will go through a multi-stage conversion process.

4. **Output Images:** The final converted images will be saved in the "FOPImages" folder.

## Verification Images:

- The "OPV1Images" and "OPV2Images" folders contain images from stages 1 and 2 of the conversion process, which can be used for verification and comparison.

### Exception Cases:

1. **exception_case_1.jpg:** This image demonstrates an exception case where the image from stage 1 is sufficient, but passing it through stage 2 results in an undesired image.

2. **exception_case_2.jpg:** In this scenario, passing the image directly through stage 2 results in an unclear image that cannot be sensed properly.

## Program Structure:

The folder called "Program in modules" contains all the code organized into individual modules for better organization and maintainability.

## Installation of Required Packages:

To run this application, you need to have the necessary packages installed. You can install them using pip, Python's package manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following commands:

```bash
# Install OpenCV
pip install opencv-python

# Install NumPy
pip install numpy


## Additional Information:

- **Smart India Hackathon 2022:** This project was presented at the Smart India Hackathon 2022.

- **MSME Grant:** The project received an MSME grant for Rs 3.90 lakhs in recognition of its value and innovation.

- **Project Version:** Note that the version presented here is the basic version of the project due to some internal reasons.

## Saliency Feature Explanation:

The saliency feature in image processing is a technique used to highlight and identify the most important or relevant areas of an image. This is particularly useful for applications like object detection, where you want to focus on the most significant parts of an image.

In the context of this project, the saliency feature may have been used to identify and prioritize key elements or regions in the images being processed during the conversion stages. For example, it could help emphasize critical details in medical images or distinguish essential components in other types of imagery.

Saliency maps generated by the feature can guide subsequent processing steps or assist in making decisions about which areas of an image to prioritize for further analysis or manipulation.

Feel free to explore the code and customize it as needed for your image conversion needs. For more details and code implementation, refer to the Python script files and modules in the project directory.
