The Exception case Images : 

1. exception case 1.jpg : As you can see that the image of the brain in stage 1 is more than enough but if we pass throught the stage 2 then we get a undesired image and can't be sensed 
2. exception case 2.jpg : If we pass the image directly through the stage 2 we get an image which is not clear and can't be sensed properly

The folder called "Program in modules" has all the codes in induvial modules
